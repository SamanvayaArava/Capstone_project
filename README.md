# Capstone_project
Targeted Problem: 
Building a machine learning model to recognize Australian Sign Language (Auslan) signs.

Justification: Educational and Assistive Technology, Such a model can be integrated into educational tools, communication devices, and assistive technologies to empower individuals who use Auslan as their primary means of communication.

Research question:  Can we create a machine learning model for dataset that correctly decodes Auslan signs, and if so, how can we improve it?

Dataset: Australian Sign Language signs - UCI Machine Learning Repository.
This dataset comprises 6,650 samples, representing 95 distinct Auslan signs. 

Motivation: Developing a machine learning model for Auslan sign recognition involves complex sequence classification, which is a challenging problem in computer vision. The potential applications of such a model in assistive technology, education, and communication systems are significant.
Contributing to a project that promotes inclusivity and accessibility for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community is a noble and motivating endeavor.The project offers an opportunity to work on a socially impactful and technically challenging problem.
